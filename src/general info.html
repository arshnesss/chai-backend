<!-- Our backend code creates a server (using frameworks like Express.js). When we run it on our system at a specific port (e.g., localhost:4000), the server becomes active and listens for incoming HTTP requests.

We use Postman (or other API testing tools) to send HTTP requests to this server to test if itâ€™s working properly.

The backend interacts with a database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) to store important details (e.g., user data, posts, orders, etc.) and fetch responses, which are then sent back to the client. -->

<!-- 2) agar kahin bhi doubt hai ki time lag skta hai toh await krwa do -->
 
<!-- 3) database query maarna yaani ki database ko call krna

4)Cookies are small pieces of data stored in a user's browser that help websites remember things like login sessions, preferences, and tracking info. 
When a user logs in, the server sends a cookie with a unique identifier (like userID or a session token).

The browser stores the cookie and automatically sends it with every request.

The server reads the cookie and identifies the user. -->

<!-- 5)access tokens and refresh tokens are types of cookies -->

<!-- 6)When a user makes a request, their browser automatically sends cookies stored in it. However, these cookies are sent as raw strings in headers, which are difficult to work with directly. -->

<!-- ðŸš€ cookie-parser parses these cookies and makes them available as a JavaScript object under req.cookies. -->

<!-- 7) jab kabhi bhi access token ka time khatam hojaye toh user ek aur request bhejta hai jismein apna refresh token saath mein bhejta hai so that the server can verify the refresh token with the refresh token stored in its database and issue him a fresh access token, basically yahan ham ek endpoint banayenge -->


<!-- 8)using jwt to verify a token by using it secret key is like opening a lock using a key to see its real contents and match with those on the server -->

<!-- 9) agar update accouatn details mein kbhi files update krwani hon toh uske endpoints alag se likhte hain -->

<!-- 10)Each stage in the MongoDB aggregation pipeline transforms the data step by step. Some stages filter data, while others modify, enrich, or reshape it. -->
