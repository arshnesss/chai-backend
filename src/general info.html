<!-- Our backend code creates a server (using frameworks like Express.js). When we run it on our system at a specific port (e.g., localhost:4000), the server becomes active and listens for incoming HTTP requests.

We use Postman (or other API testing tools) to send HTTP requests to this server to test if itâ€™s working properly.

The backend interacts with a database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) to store important details (e.g., user data, posts, orders, etc.) and fetch responses, which are then sent back to the client. -->

<!-- 2) agar kahin bhi doubt hai ki time lag skta hai toh await krwa do -->
 
<!-- 3) database query maarna yaani ki database ko call krna

4)Cookies are small pieces of data stored in a user's browser that help websites remember things like login sessions, preferences, and tracking info. 
When a user logs in, the server sends a cookie with a unique identifier (like userID or a session token).

The browser stores the cookie and automatically sends it with every request.

The server reads the cookie and identifies the user. -->

<!-- 5)access tokens and refresh tokens are types of cookies -->

<!-- 6)When a user makes a request, their browser automatically sends cookies stored in it. However, these cookies are sent as raw strings in headers, which are difficult to work with directly. -->

<!-- ðŸš€ cookie-parser parses these cookies and makes them available as a JavaScript object under req.cookies. -->
