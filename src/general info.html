<!-- Our backend code creates a server (using frameworks like Express.js). When we run it on our system at a specific port (e.g., localhost:4000), the server becomes active and listens for incoming HTTP requests.

We use Postman (or other API testing tools) to send HTTP requests to this server to test if it’s working properly.

The backend interacts with a database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) to store important details (e.g., user data, posts, orders, etc.) and fetch responses, which are then sent back to the client. -->
